## Lab01 : Gray, anti-white and binarization
- Goal :      
Complete gray, anti-white and binarization in an any image.
>
- Method :      
Use python, OpenCV and Numpy to deal with the image array.
>
- Result :

## Lab03 : Histogram equalization
- Goal :      
Use skimage to complete global histogram equalization and local histogram equalization. In addition, try to practice global histogram equalization by own programming skill.
>
- Method :      
Use python, skimage and Numpy to deal with the image array.
>
- Result :

## Lab04 : Kuwahara filter
- Goal :      
Use two different neighborhood to practice Kuwahara filter, and compare the difference between these images.
>
- Method :      
Use python, skimage and Numpy to deal with the image array.
>
- Result :

## Lab05 : Distortion correction
- Goal :      
Find the skull in a paint, The Ambassadors. It was painted by Hans HOLBEIN the Younger.
>
- Method :      
Use python, skimage and Numpy to deal with the image array.
>
- Result :
